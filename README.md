### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bipin Thapa, an infosec enthusiast, wannabe hacker and freelance web developer with content writing hobby. I love learning how things work. I shifted to breaking things after realizing that I was better at breaking than in creating, while working as a web developer. LOL :joy: 

I spend most of my my time solving vulnerable labs, doing individual security researches and CTFs(more often).
